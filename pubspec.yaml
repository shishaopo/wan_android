description: 测试玩Android flutter版.

# 决定当前项目是否需要发布到pub.dev上`flutter pub publish`
publish_to: 'none' #如果像发布到pub.dev上，需要把这一行删了

# 这里定义了App的build-name和build-number.build-name可以随便命名，但是build-number必须比上个版本大才可以覆盖安装
# build-name必须3个数字，并且中间必须用小数点分割，像1.2.3.
# build-name和build-number都可以通过命令行修改：--build-name 和 --build-number
# 在Android中, build-name会替换versionName，build-number会替换versionCode.
# 在iOS中, build-name会替换CFBundleShortVersionString，build-number会替换CFBundleVersion.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
